#### Resources
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below are links to the planning documents we created. We drew up a few user profiles, and created user stories. We used the user stories to assist in making a basic wireframe to show a rough picture of how we will build the app. We used the project manager on Git Hub to create our task list for the project.
